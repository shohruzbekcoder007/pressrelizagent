"""
Per-user Hermes profile isolation.

Each user gets a full Hermes home of their own:

    <HERMES_USERS_HOME>/<slug>/
        config.yaml  memories/  skills/  sessions/  plugins/  logs/

`agents.hermes_host` activates one of these per request with Hermes'
`set_hermes_home_override()` context var, so memory, session history and
`session_search` all resolve inside the caller's own directory. Hermes reads
its home through `get_hermes_home()` on every call for exactly this reason
(see `tools/memory_tool.py::get_memory_dir`), so the redirect reaches the
tools too — not just the agent object.

The slug is the security boundary: it comes from a request header and ends up
as a directory name, so it is validated here and nowhere else.
